# Project 0

## Summary
This site includes a mix of personal and professional resume items.

A bootstrap navigation menu is used to navigate between pages.  In addition to the navigation menu, each page includes a header and a footer which remain static between pages.

Without the knowledge of additional tools, the menu, header and footer are repeated in each HTML page.  I expect we will learn how to avoid this later in the class.

A separate css file was used for SCSS components in order to highlight satisfied requirements.  All css could have been combined into one file but was left separate for assignment grading readability.

The viewport meta tag on each page was adjusted to allow reasonable display on my retina mobile device.  I did not take measures to ensure that the site looked reasonable on all mobile devices since this was outside the scope of the assignment.

#### Frameworks
- In addition to HTML and CSS, the following frameworks were installed and used:
  - SAAS - to use SCSS (SCSS_project0.scss is the source and SCSS_proect0.css is the target.)
  - Bootstrap - referenced in header via web link to bootstrap css file.

#### HTML Pages
- Each page includes a tailored bootstrap grid that changes the nav menu and contents as the viewport changes width.

  - index.html (This is also the "About" page)
  - experience.html - A list of professional jobs
  - education.html - A list of degrees and institutions as well as special skills
  - entrepreneurial.html - Includes a list of part-time businesses I established
  - endeavors.html - A list of personal interests, certifications and interests

#### CSS/SCSS Pages
- css/bootstrap.min.css - Bootstrap CSS settings
- css/CSS_project0.css - CSS settings used by the site
- css/SCSS_project0.css/scss - Saas settings used by the site

#### Images
- images/email_icon.png - An email icon used to highlight the email link in the footer.
- images/profile_photo.jpg - Profile photo used on About page.
