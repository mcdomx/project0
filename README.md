# Project 0
[a link](https://mcdomx.github.io/project0/)

## Summary
This site includes a mix of personal and professional resume items.

A bootstrap navigation menu is used to navigate between pages.  In addition to the navigation menu, each page includes a header and a footer which remain static between pages.

Without using Javascript or Python, the menu, header and footer are repeated in each HTML page.  Avoiding this is saved as an exercise when subsequent components are learned later in the class.

#### HTML Pages

- experience.html - A list of professional jobs
