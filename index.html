            <p>
              A lifelong interest in computing technology led me to leave my career in corporate finance to pursue a degree in computer engineering.  At 12 years old, I started with a Commodore computer learning basic and spending evenings and weekends copying code from books to make games.  Upon chosing a university degree, I opted to pursue Accounting as it seemed to offer greater opportunity at the time.  I spent most of my career applying computing technology to financial processes and spent several years of my career focused on the mangement of information technology before working my way to a corporate controller position.<br>
              <br>
              Over the years, I had the opportunity to pursue sevral part-time entrepreneurial interests while advancing my professional career.  Directly out of university, I spent some of my free time doing basic accounting work for 2 small proprietorships.  My career job eventually forced me to stop providing this service.  Later, I recognized an underserved market in roommate placement services.  I founded Roommate Finders with a weekly ad in the classified and second phone line.  I matched hundreds of roommates over a 2 year period but had to close the business when my job took me to a new location overseas.  After returning to the States, I found another underserved market in the area I was living in a purchased a PortraitEFX franchise.  I spent 2 years as the team photographer for various sports leagues in the Pittsburgh area.  Again, my career moved me and I had to reluctanly sell a very successful part-time business.<br>
              <br>
              Outside of working, I've been able to pursue several personal endeavors including private piloting, bicycle racing and photography.<br>
              <br>
              I aim combine my experience and skills in a future career in sofware engineering, design and management.<br>
